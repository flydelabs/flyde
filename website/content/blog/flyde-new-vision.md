# Flyde's New Vision: The Missing Link for AI Workflows

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a paradigm shift in how software is built and maintained. AI-heavy workflows are becoming increasingly complex, involving prompt chains, agents, and sophisticated feedback loops that traditional development approaches struggle to handle effectively.

Today, I'm excited to share Flyde's new vision as **the missing link between developers and non-developers working on AI workflows**.

## The Challenge with Current AI Workflow Tools

Current tools in the AI workflow space often fall into two categories:

1. **Developer-focused tools**: Code libraries like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and others provide powerful abstractions but remain accessible only to developers.

2. **No-code platforms**: Drag-and-drop interfaces that democratize AI creation but operate as isolated platforms disconnected from production codebases.

This creates a significant gap - either non-technical team members are excluded from the process, or developers must maintain parallel implementations (one for prototyping, one for production).

## Flyde: In-Codebase Visual Development

Flyde takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **In-codebase**: Flyde runs directly within your existing codebase, with complete access to runtime code
- **Library-based**: Integrates seamlessly with existing frameworks, tools, and CI/CD pipelines
- **Visual extension of TypeScript**: Provides a visual layer that maintains type safety and developer experience

This unique approach enables a workflow where:

1. Developers can build foundations and complex components in code
2. Both developers and non-developers can visually design, inspect, and modify high-level AI workflows
3. Everything stays in the codebase - no translations, exports, or parallel implementations

## Key Features of Flyde for AI Workflows

- **Visual AI Flow Design**: Design complex AI workflows with nodes for LLM calls, prompt management, tool selection, and more
- **Runtime Debugging**: Watch your AI workflows execute in real-time, seeing inputs/outputs and execution paths
- **Live Prompt Engineering**: Collaboratively edit and test prompts directly in the visual interface
- **Production Integration**: Deploy the same flows you design directly to production environments

## What's Next

In the coming weeks, we'll be releasing:

1. A public beta of Flyde with enhanced AI workflow components
2. Integration examples with popular frameworks like Next.js, Express, and others
3. Documentation and tutorials specifically for AI workflow use cases

Stay tuned for more updates! If you're building AI workflows and want to bridge the gap between your technical and non-technical team members, we'd love to hear from you.
