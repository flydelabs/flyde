# Vision

Name: Flyde
Website: https://www.flyde.dev
Author: Gabriel Grinberg

Flyde is the missing link between developers and non-developers working on AI workflows.

It provides an holistic solution for prototyping, integrating, evaluating and iterating on AI-heavy backend logic, such as AI agents, prompt chains, agentic workflows. 

Unlike existing tools, it runs in-codebase, via a library, with access to runtime code and is integrated as a library into existing frameworks, tools and CI/CD pipelines.
It is a visual extension of Typescript that lowers the collaboration barrier
