## Introduction

`Flyde` is an open-source visual programming language built to integrate with your existing codebase. It allows you to create and run visual programs and is designed to complement and enhance traditional textual coding, not to replace it. It includes a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flyde.flyde-vscode), seamlessly integrates with existing TypeScript/JavaScript code and runs on Node.js and in the browser.

## Quick Start

### Playground

The easiest way to experiment with Flyde is to visit the [online playground](https://flyde.dev/playground), which allows you to create and run flows in the browser.

### Running locally

1. Install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flyde.flyde-vscode)
2. `mkdir my-flyde-project && cd my-flyde-project`
3. Open your project in VSCode
4. Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) -> `Flyde: New visual flow`
5. Check out the [Integrating with Existing Code](https://www.flyde.dev/docs/integrate-flows) guide to learn how to integrate your flows with your code

## Who is Flyde for?

- **Novice Developers and Non-Technical Users:** Flyde simplifies programming by transforming complex code into accessible visual blocks, making it an ideal entry point for those new to development or from non-technical backgrounds.

- **Team Collaboration Across Roles:** Flyde democratizes innovation by enabling team members like product managers and data engineers to contribute directly to the codebase through visual programming, fostering collaboration and understanding.

- **Educators in Programming:** Flyde is a valuable resource for educators seeking to provide hands-on, interactive programming education by blending visual learning with real-world coding concepts.

- **Seasoned Developers:** Flyde offers experienced developers a new dimension of efficiency for designing, prototyping, and managing APIs and microservices visually, while retaining the flexibility and power of traditional coding. Its open-source nature and the commercial platform [Flowcode](https://www.getflowcode.io?ref=readme) provide further customization and cloud-hosted capabilities.

And many more!
