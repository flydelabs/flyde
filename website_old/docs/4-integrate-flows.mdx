# Integrating with Existing Code

A core tenet of Flyde is that it should **integrate with existing code, and not replace it**.

To achieve this, Flyde provides a runtime library that allows you to load and run .flyde files, and a webpack loader that allows you to load .flyde files directly from your code. Also, custom nodes can be implemented using TypeScript or JavaScript (more on that in the [custom nodes article](/docs/custom-nodes)).

For example, given a .flyde flow that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit:

<img src={Image} width="400" />

You can load and run it from your code as following:

```ts
import { loadFlow } from "@flyde/runtime";

const execute = await loadFlow("./celsius-to-fahrenheit.flyde");

const inputs = { celsius: 0 }; // "celcius" is a main input in the flow, therefore it must be provided when executing the flow
const { result } = execute(inputs); // execute returns a "result" promise, along with a cleanup function that can be used to cancel the execution.

const { fahrenheit } = await result; // each output in the flow is a property on the result object

console.log(result.fahrenheit); // 32
```

The `execute` function returns an object with a `result` property - a promise that resolves to the result of the flow.

You may also listen to outputs before the flow completes by passing an "onOutputs" callback to the second argument of `execute`:

```ts
const { result } = execute(inputs, {
  onOutputs: (key, value) => {
    console.log(`output with key ${key} emitted value ${value}`);
  },
});
```

The example above assumes a Node.js environment. Loading Flyde in a browser environment is possible, but not yet documented. Checkout the website's source code, [here](https://github.com/flydelabs/flyde/blob/main/website/src/pages/_examples.ts) and [here](https://github.com/flydelabs/flyde/blob/main/website/docusaurus.config.js#L18) for an example of how to do it.

Another key method of intgrating with existing code is by creating your own custom nodes. Learn more about that in the [custom nodes article](/docs/custom-nodes).
