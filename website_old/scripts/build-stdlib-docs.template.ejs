# Flyde Nodes Library

This is the documentation for the Flyde Nodes Library. It contains all the parts that are available in the @flyde/stdlib
(which is copied to @flyde/runtime for convenience).

For simplicity, all parts of Flyde's standard library reside in the same package, and is organized into namespaces.  

**Available sections:** <% for (const group of groups) { %>
- [<%- group.ns %>](#<%- group.ns.replace(/\s+/g, '-') %>)
<% } %>

<% for (const group of groups) { %>
## <%- group.ns %>

<%- group.table %>
<% } %>
